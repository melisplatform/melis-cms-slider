# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Melis CMS Slider and the wider Melis Platform seriously.
**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security problems.**

Report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub — use *Security → Report a
vulnerability* (private vulnerability reporting) on this repository.

Please include, when possible:

- the affected file(s) and version/commit,
- a description of the impact,
- the steps or a source-only proof of concept needed to reproduce.

## What to expect

- Acknowledgement of your report within **5 business days**.
- An initial assessment (severity, affected versions) within **10 business days**.
- Coordinated disclosure: we will agree a timeline with you before any public
  advisory or CVE request, and we publish a fix before disclosing details.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest `5.3.x` release line. Older lines are
handled case by case.

## Credit

We credit reporters in the release notes / advisory unless you ask us not to.
If you would like a CVE, tell us and we will request one on your behalf.

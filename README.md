- MelisCmsNewsService  
  Services to retrieve lists of sliders, slider details and save sliders  
  File: /melis-cms-slider/src/Service/MelisCmsSliderService.php

```
// Get the service
$sliderService = $this->getServiceManager()->get('MelisCmsSliderService');
// Get slider by id
$data = $sliderService->getSlider($sliderId);
```

### MelisSlider Forms

#### Forms factories

All Melis CMS Slider forms are built using Form Factories.  
All form configuration are available in the file: /melis-cms-slider/config/app.forms.php  
Any module can override or add items in this form by building the keys in an array and marge it in the Module.php config creation part.

```
return array(
	'plugins' => array(

		// MelisCmsNews array
		'MelisCmsSlider' => array(

			// Form key
			'forms' => array(

				// MelisCmsNews Properties form
				'MelisTechnologySlider_details_form' => array(
					'attributes' => array(
						'name' => 'sliderDetailsForm',
						'id' => 'sliderDetailsForm',
						'enctype' => "multipart/form-data",
						'method' => 'POST',
						'action' => '',
					),
					'hydrator'  => 'Laminas\Hydrator\ArraySerializableHydrator',
					'elements' => array(
						array(
							'spec' => array(
									...
							),
						),
					),
					'input_filter' => array(
						'mcsdetail_id' => array(
								...
						),
					),
				),
			),
		),
	),
),
```

#### Forms elements

MelisCmsSlider provides form elements to be used in forms:

- CmsSliderSelect: a dropdown to select a slider

### Listening to services and update behavior with custom code

Most services trigger events so that the behavior can be modified.

```
public function attach(EventManagerInterface $events)
{
    $sharedEvents      = $events->getSharedManager();

	$callBackHandler = $sharedEvents->attach(
		'MelisCmsSlider',
		array(
			'meliscmsslider_delete_details_end',
		),
		function($e){

			$sm = $e->getTarget()->getEvent()->getApplication()->getServiceManager()
			$sm = $e->getTarget()->getEvent()->getApplication()->getServiceManager()
    		$params = $e->getParams();

    		// Custom code here

    	},
    100);

    $this->listeners[] = $callBackHandler;
}
```
